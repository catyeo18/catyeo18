## Hi, I'm Catherine 👋

👩🏻‍💻 I'm an undergrad at Harvard studying Computer Science with a minor in English. Previously I've interned in AI research, software engineering, and project management roles at IBM, Apple, and nonprofits. I'm interested in researching & building tools that create social impact, especially in relation to fairness/accessibility, privacy, and education.

🔭 I'm a member of MIT CSAIL's Internet Policy Research Initiative group researching conversational, natural language systems used to make CS education more accessible. I also write about fairness and ethics in AI in my blog [Fair Bytes](http://fairbytes.org/).

😄 I love hackathons and have organized 10 hackathons (from institutional to international). I founded and led PixelHacks, the Bay Area's first all-female high school hackathon (now in its 5th iteration). I currently direct HackHarvard.
